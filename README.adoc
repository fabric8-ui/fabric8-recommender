**Fabric8 Recommender is a stack analysis feature.**

== Running the app

=== Set NODE_ENV
If you're just trying to test the application, please use inmemory mode which
will load the app with mock data for you. If you, however, want to contribute
to the codebase, unset it back or to "development" (default) mode and rebuild.


[source,shell]
```
$ export NODE_ENV=inmemory # <1>
$ export NODE_ENV=development # <2>
$ export NODE_ENV=production # <3>

<1> In-memory mode for trying-out the app
<2> Development mode for contributing to the source
<2> Production mode for deploying the application
```

Once you're done setting the environment, you can proceed with the next step(s)

NOTE: If you're directly trying to run the app in dev mode, you can skip this
step, as *`NODE_ENV`* is treated as `"development"` by default.

=== First run

If you're trying to run the app for the first time:

 $ npm install

Then, start the app with:

 $ npm start

=== Fresh run

If you trying to refresh your installation, you need to run:

 $ npm run reinstall

Then, start the app with:

 $ npm start

=== Testcase run

To run the linter, unit tests, and functional test use:

 $ npm test

== Other useful scripts

The *`package.json`* file's `scripts:` section lists _all the tasks_ we run.

Here are some of the most useful/frequently used scripts you may need to run:

[cols="1,2,4", options="header"]
|===
|Scipt
|Command
|Description

|Lint
|`$ npm run lint`
|Runs the TypeScript and Angular 2 linter

|Validation
|`$ npm run validate`
|Validates the webpack build

|Unit Tests
|`$ npm run test:unit`
|Runs the unit tests

|Functional Tests
|`$ npm run test:func`
|Runs the functional tests

|Continuous Tests
|`$ npm run watch:test`
|Looks for changes in source code and runs unit tests

== Building the app

=== Production build

To generate production build, set API URL and run build script as follows:

----
$ npm run build:prod
----

The build output will be under `dist` directory.

*To create a docker image,* run this command immediately after the production
build completion:

----

=== Library Build

==== For production:

To build the fabric8-stack-analysis-ui as an npm library, use:

----
$ npm run build
----

The created library will be placed in `dist`.

IMPORTANT: *You shouldn't ever publish the build manually,* instead you should
let the CD pipeline do a semantic release.

==== For development:

To build fabric8-stack-analysis-ui as an npm library and embed it into a webapp such as
fabric8-ui, you should:

Step 1: Run `npm run watch:library` in the source directory::
This will build fabric8-stack-analysis-ui as a library and then set up a watch task to
rebuild any ts, html and scss files you change.

Step 2: Run `npm link <path to fabric8-stack-analysis-ui>/dist-watch`::
In the webapp into which you are embedding. This will create a symlink from
`node_modules/fabric8-stack-analysis-ui` to the `dist-watch` directory and install that
symlinked node module into your webapp.

Step 3: Run your webapp in development mode::
Make sure you have a watch on `node_modules/fabric8-stack-analysis-ui` enabled. You will
have access to both JS and SASS sourcemaps if your webapp is properly setup.

NOTE: `fabric8-ui` is setup to do reloading and sourcemaps automatically when you
run `npm start`.

== CSS and SASS

fabric8-stack-analysis-ui uses SASS for it's stylesheets. It also uses the Angular emulation
of the shadow dom, so you will normally want to place your styles in the
`.component.scss` file next to the html and the typescript.


We use mixins to avoid polluting components with uncessary style classes, and to avoid
an explosion of shared files.

The `src/assets/stylesheets/` directory includes a `shared` directory. These are
shared global styles that we will refactor out in to a shared library at some point.
Only update these styles if you are making a truly global style, and are going to
synchronise your changes across all the various UI projects.
